"The Walks" is a collection of short radio plays for specific locations in your city and an invitation to rediscover your surroundings and to interact with them. About 20 minutes are enough to do an audio walk yourself. Go whenever you want. You can decide for yourself how many of the walks you want to do in which order. The stories and soundscapes of the short radio plays can be experienced worldwide. Thus "The Walks" connects people around the globe in a local experience through a fundamental human act: walking.

With the corona pandemic, walking in public spaces took on a new meaning. An ancient and everyday ritual became a central component of the new normal: people meet, walk, stride through neighborhoods, play in landscapes and perceive their surroundings anew with every walk.

"The Walks" understands walking as a theatrical scenario: an audio-guided walk in parks, a staged walk in supermarkets or timed interactions on river banks. In every city, places familiar with voices, noises and music gradually become scenes and landscapes become stages: through narratives, dialogical situations, choreographic explorations or musical-rhythmic variations of walking. The title of each walk shows you where or how it is performed: "Walk for a cemetery", "Walk on the water" or "Walk for a traffic island".
