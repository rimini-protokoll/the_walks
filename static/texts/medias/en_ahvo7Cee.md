What leads politicians to green spaces? What is political about a relationship between two people? Start this walk by arranging to meet someone in a park.

You and your partner will simultaneously listen to different tracks. Settle on who listens to A and who listens to B with a coin toss. To ensure the simultaneous playback of your walks

 *choose the download option below*
 put your phones on “Do Not Disturb”. This is not the same as “Flight Mode” and will maintain your internet connection:

\[iOS] → Settings → Do Not Disturb
\[Android] → Settings → Sounds and Vibration → Do Not Disturb

Once you have done this, start counting from 3 and begin your tracks simultaneously.
