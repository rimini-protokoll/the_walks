This a duet. Arrange to meet a companion in front of a supermarket. 
To ensure the simultaneous playback of your walks

_ choose the download option below  
_ put your phones on “Do Not Disturb”. This is not the same as “Flight Mode” and will maintain your internet connection


[iOS] → Settings → Do Not Disturb
[Android] → Settings → Sounds and Vibration → Do Not Disturb


You will simultaneously be listening to two different tracks. One person chooses A and the other chooses B. Slowly count down from 3. When you reach 0, start your walks simultaneously.
