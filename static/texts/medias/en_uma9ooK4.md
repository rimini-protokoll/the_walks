This a duet. Arrange to meet with someone in front of a supermarket. To ensure the simultaneous playback of your walks, put your phones on “Do Not Disturb”. This is not the same as “Airplane Mode” and will maintain your internet connection:
iOS → Settings → Do Not Disturb
Android → Settings → Sounds and Vibration → Do Not Disturb
You will simultaneously be listening to two different tracks. One person chooses A and the other chooses B. Slowly count down from 3. When you reach 0, start your walks simultaneously.
