This is a duet. Make a date with someone in front of the same supermarket. If you understand English, we recommend the English version of this walk ( → Menu → Language).
To ensure simultaneous playback of your walks, set your mobile phones to "Do not disturb". This is not flight mode and preserves the internet connection:
iOS → Settings → Do Not Disturb /
Android → Settings → Sounds → Do not disturb
You will hear different tracks at the same time. One person chooses A, the other chooses B. Count down together from 3. At 0, you will start your walks at the same time.
