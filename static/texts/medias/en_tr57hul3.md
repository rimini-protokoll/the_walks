      Let's start with the easiest one: the \"Do not disturb\" function. The
      \"Do not disturb\" setting is not the flight mode. It maintains your
      internet connection during your Walk. Now, with iOS (Apple), go to
      \"Settings.\" Activate \"Do not disturb\" there. With most Android devices
      (Google), you can find this feature under Settings → Sounds → Do Not
      Disturb."

      about taking a photo with your camera during the Walk and uploading it to
      the app. We need your permission to do that."

Meet in pairs or as a group of three AT a playground, but don’t go in yet.
