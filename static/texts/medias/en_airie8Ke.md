  - title: "For this walk to work synchronously, you should make a few settings.
      Let's start with the easiest one: the \"Do not disturb\" function. The
      \"Do not disturb\" setting is not the flight mode. It maintains your
      internet connection during your Walk. Now, with iOS (Apple), go to
      \"Settings\" → \"Focus\". Activate \"Do not disturb\" there. With most
      Android devices (Google), you can find this feature under Settings →
      Sounds → Do Not Disturb."

      Don't worry, we're not trying to take control of your device. It's just
      about taking a photo with your camera during the Walk and uploading it to
      the app. We need your permission to do that."

      In order to be able to locate your photo geographically on the world map
      of The Walks, we need your GPS coordinate. It will be saved in the photo
      file.
