‘The Walks’ is a collection of short audio plays for specific places in your city and an invitation to rediscover and interact with your surroundings. As little as 20 minutes are sufficient to do an audio walk yourself. You can unlock all content (walks) at once in the App. You conclude the necessary contract for use (i.e. playback) either by entering an activation code or by making a binding payment in money. The price for payment in money is EUR 4.99.

Before we can conclude the contract, we ask you to carefully read our notice as well as our (Privacy Policy)[], our (Terms of Use)[] and our (Cancellation Policy)[] and to give us your (consent to the data transfer)[] (when using Stripe and when voluntarily uploading photos) and to the early provision of the content before the end of your cancellation period:

Warning: Rimini Protokoll advises you that you can listen to our Walks while moving in public traffic areas. Please move carefully and observe local rules and regulations regarding traffic.
